This project builds a data pipeline to create a platform to predict the booking lead time for a given airbnb listing and travel date. Booking lead time is a metric defined as the number of days between reservation date and check-in date. The data query happens in flask and visualized by a plug-in installed on chrome browser.
The lead time prediction is made by ingesting 480 GB of historical data from airbnb collected for the past few years.
